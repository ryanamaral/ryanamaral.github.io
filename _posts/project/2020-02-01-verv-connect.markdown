#### Verv Connect - Appliance predictive maintenance

Verv can identify signs of component fatigue and locate faults that are occurring or are about to occur, in the utmost detail, alerting appliance manufacturers and in turn their customers to recommended action.

Energy signatures are created by energy consumption data. We sample this data at 10,000 times a second, meaning that we have a high resolution image of performance. This allows us to capture behaviour that often cannot cost effectively be detected with the traditional use of sensors or lower resolution monitoring. With the addition of AI, Verv can train its algorithms to detect faults that may previously have gone unidentified.
