#### Bubble

*Always know where your child is.*

This app allows you to have your children inside a bubble and let them play freely without worrying about losing them (at a park or simply inside a playground where they are out of sight).  

When the child leaves the range of the bubble (smartphone of the parents), an alert with a sound notification is sent to the smartphone. This bubble range is programmable.  

This app is designed to work in combination with a Bluetooth LE sticker.
