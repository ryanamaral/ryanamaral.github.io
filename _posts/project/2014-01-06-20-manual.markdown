#### 20 Manual

*A new approach for textbooks.*

Application that provides access to the projects of the scholar publishers from LeYa Group

Whether online or offline, the educational tools can be used in a simple and intuitive way.

notebook, teacher support materials and multimedia resources.  

The text book is interactive, providing search tools and also writing on or underlining its
pages.  

The interactive notebook enables the user to make notes, take pictures, and then record
and share everything by email.  

The multimedia resources include videos, animations, presentations, simulations,
interactive activities, among others.
