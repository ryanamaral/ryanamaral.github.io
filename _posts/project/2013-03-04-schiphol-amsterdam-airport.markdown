####Schiphol Amsterdam Airport
This is the official Amsterdam Airport Schiphol application. Schiphol is one of the largest and most innovative travel hubs in the world. For Schiphol it is an ongoing challenge to keep improving their high level of service, lead position in airport innovation, and brand image towards their 120.000 passengers per day. When Schiphol decided to embrace the opportunity to support their passengers via mobile, they approached M2Mobi for a strategy on how to merge ‘a lot of people’ and ‘a lot of information’ into a user friendly mobile solution, leading to the creation of one of the most compelling and complete airport apps in the world. You can use it to see up-todate arrival and departure information for all flights, along with a search for flights by destination, flight number or airline. You can also receive push notifications about status changes to flights you’ve selected. It also gives you all the practical Schiphol travel information, like floor plans to manage to find your way in the airport, or parking reservation.
