####AMC Navigation
If you ask people about their visit to a hospital, they usually start talking about their health or worries about a loved one they are visiting.
People also mention basic practical things: they know the medical staff is doing its utmost to care for their patients, but why is it so hard to park your car and find the right place to go? Why should all kinds of small things add unrest to an already stressed visit? It shouldn't.
That is what this app is for. It was created with the AMC (Academic Medical Center).
