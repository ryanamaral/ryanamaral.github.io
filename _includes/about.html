            <h4>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h4>
            <p>I'm Ryan Amaral. I am an enthusiastic Android developer currently working as a contractor. I took my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science degree in Coimbra, Portugal. In 2012 I published a personal Android app that reached the mark of 10 million downloads! Working on new ideas is my greatest passion! While crafting applications I apply the most up-to-date practices of Android development that I learn every year at Droidcon's around Europe.</p>
