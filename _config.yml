about: "Hi there! I'm Ryan Amaral. I am an enthusiastic Android developer currently working as freelancer. I took my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science degree in Coimbra, Portugal. In 2012 I developed my first own Android app and in only 4 months it reached the mark of 1 million downloads. Working on new ideas is my greatest passion! While crafting applications I apply the best practices of mobile development and the principles of material design."
